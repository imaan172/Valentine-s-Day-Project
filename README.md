Valentines Day Project is a simple yes or no question, inspired by Mewtru, for the one playing hard to get ( or maybe you're just hard to want ).

<h2>Technologies</h2>
- HTML <br>
- CSS <br>
- JavaScript <br>

<h2>Features</h2>
VDP is fairly simple to understand. You have 2 options, 'Yes' or 'No', which ultimately comes down to the same outcome.
<h3>'Yes' Button</h3>
Once the 'Yes' button is clicked it takes the user to the next page ( final outcome of the project ). Since you'd want the user to say yes, now don't you ?
<h3>'No' Button</h3>
The 'No' button on the other hand has more features to it. <br>
With each click of the 'No' button the message on the button changes, while simultaneously the 'Yes' button increases in size. <br>
The messages on the 'No' button progressively gets more desperate, which in return urges the user to say yes. Adding to the satire of the project. <br>
With a certain amount of clicks given to the 'No' button, the 'Yes' button takes over the screen giving the user no other choice but to say yes. <br>
Thus completing the cycle of the project.

<h2>Process</h2>
I started with the basic structure of the project using HTML. <br>
Once I was satisfied with the structure of the website, I moved to the design aspect of it using CSS. <br>
I aligned and centered all elements of the webpage, before I went on a hunt for a colour scheme. <br>
Shortly after I realised I did not like any colour scheme, nor did I actually need one in the first place. I went with a subtle red and green colour for the buttons, since I wanted the look of my webpage to give a more softer look rather than demanding. <br>
Once I was happy with the look, I moved onto the functionality for the buttons. <br>
I spent a good half hour trying to figure out how on earth I was going to do this, since when I found this project it was just a TikTok video. <br>
I struggled at first however I just applied the logic I'd use when using the webpage and turned that into JavaScript code.

<h2>What I Learnt</h2>
- Not everything needs a colour scheme, as much as I enjoy colour schemes I wasted time with it. <br>
- Basic JavaScript is not as difficult as I thought it would be, requires a bit of brain power, however it is just logic. Given, this is my first completed project using JavaScript ( emphasis on completed ). Don't get me wrong I understand this is just the basics. <br>
- I have a much better understanding of DOM manipulation. <br>
- I have finally put proper flexbox work into practice, all the studying paid off. <br>
- Allowing myself to struggle before seeking help, since I could figure out most of my obstacles by myself.

<h2>Improvements</h2>
- First point of improvement would be changing this project to suit myself more in terms of functionality, giving myself an opportunity to create new ideas and build on my skill set I currently have. <br>
- I would have wanted this to be more responsive. I spent a bit of time on a media query, however I am not entirely sure if it worked or not. <br>
- An idea that came to me while I was busy with the functionality was keeping my comments I added, since I am still learning and now I can refer back to my previous work and immediately understand what each section of code does. <br>
- One thing I would have liked to add is the image on the screen transitioning as the user clicks the 'No' button. I would have liked the image to slowing become more desperate / sad as the person says no. <br>
<br>
That concludes my Valentines Day Project <3
